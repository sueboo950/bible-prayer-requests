# Bible Prayer Requests

## About the Project

This project is a continuation of my original capstone project where I had a prayer request page attached. 

This time I am including the same concept with a bit of a difference to include the need for help resources for suicide and addiction prevention linked on the splash page along with provided a bible resource for those requesting prayer pertaining to their request.
